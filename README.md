## **Package Description**

> The purpose of this DBT project is to help folks with getting started with Heap data synced to a data warehouse via Heap Connect. 
> This project comes with the following baked in: 
> 1. A heap_sources.yml file which includes documentation, freshness checks, and basic tests for the built-in views that ship with Heap Connect
> 2. Logic to handle incremental table transformations of the source data synced to your warehouse via Heap Connect
> 3. Macros which can be used to quickly spin up attribution and funnel analysis 
> 4. An opinionated viewpoint on how to best structure DBT projects in terms of folder structure and naming conventions in order to promote adoption and collaboration

## **Materialized Table Schemas**

### **stg_heap_events_all_inc_fct** 

*This table contains a row for each event synced to Heap. This table automatically includes pageviews but will also include events toggled to sync via Heap Connect in the Heap UI*
